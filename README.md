# CPU-Scheduling-algorithms
cpu scheduling algorithms(SJF-FCSF-LIFO-RR) - implementation of different cpu scheduling algorithms using python. It demonstrates average waiting time, turnaround and response time of mentioned algorithms.
to print output(u should comment the part for drawing chart), run python cpuScheduling.py in terminal
to produce a PDF chart, run python cpuScheduling.py --format=pdf >cpuScheduling.pdf in terminal
